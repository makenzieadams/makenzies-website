    <p>
      Arguably the most important thing to know about me is that I love to stay
      busy. <br />
      So busy, in fact, that I currently have <strong>THREE</strong> jobs. I am
      a licensed NC Realtor¬Æ, a Transaction Settlement Specialist, and a full
      time Software Engineering student at FlatIron School. <br />
      If you's like to count dog mom to three perfect doggos with
      <strong>BIG</strong> personalities, make that 4 jobs. <br />
      In my down-time, (albeit rare), I enjoy cleaning (yes, really), watching
      true crime videos, binging whatever my current favorite show is (plug: SEE
      on Apple TV), and visiting local breweries with my better half. <br />
      I have many goals in life, and I add on to them quite often. Insert:
      Learning to code. <br />
      In addition to this new adventure, I look forward to hosting my own
      Airbnb's in the near future, building my real estate portfolio, and
      eventually opening a no-kill shelter. <br />
      Busy may be the understatement of the century, but I wouldn't have it any
      other way! I cannot wait to see where the next year of life takes me -
      specifically in this moment I am amused at the thought of looking back at
      this website when my schooling is all said and done and laughing a little
      at how far I've come. <br />
      Hopefully I'll see you somewhere along the way. <br />
      <br />
      The quote I live by, and encourage whoever is reading this to consider as
      well:
